I am making a portfolio to show Data Visualization Projects I have worked on over the years.

## Project 1: [E-commerce Sales Analysis](https://github.com/ArijeetB-neu/Data-Visualization/tree/main/P1-Ecommerce%20Sales%20Analysis).
Developed an E-commerce sales analysis project using Tableau Desktop to examine 115K transactions across global marketplaces. The project delves into YTD, QTD, PQTD sales, market trends, product performance, customer segments, and shipment details, providing actionable insights for refining marketing strategies and introducing new products.

Proficiencies include: Tableau Desktop, Data Cleaning methods
